Prudential Life Insurance 
============================
Problem Statement:
--------------------
In a one-click shopping world with on-demand everything, the life insurance application process is antiquated. Customers provide extensive information to identify risk classification and eligibility, including scheduling medical exams, a process that takes an average of 30 days.
People are turned off. Thatâ€™s why only 40% of U.S. households own individual life insurance.

Objective:
--------------
To develop a predictive model that is quicker, less labor-intensive for new and existing customers and to accurately classifies risk using an automated approach.
