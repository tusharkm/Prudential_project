Prudential Life Insurance 
============================
Problem Statement:
--------------------
In a one-click shopping world with on-demand everything, the life insurance application process is antiquated. Customers provide extensive information to identify risk classification and eligibility, including scheduling medical exams, a process that takes an average of 30 days.
People are turned off. Thatâ€™s why only 40% of U.S. households own individual life insurance.

Prudential wants to make it quicker and less labor intensive for new and existing customers to get a quote while maintaining privacy boundaries.

Objective:
--------------
To develop a predictive model that accurately classifies risk using a automated approach, you can greatly impact public perception of the industry.

Models developed
----------------
Linear Regression
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine
